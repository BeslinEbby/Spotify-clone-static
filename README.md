# Spotify Clone — Static

A static, responsive recreation of the Spotify layout using only HTML and CSS (no frameworks). This project is a static UI clone for educational purposes and is not affiliated with Spotify. 

### Live demo:  https://beslinebby.github.io/Spotify-clone-static/

### Overview 

The project reproduces the visual structure of Spotify’s homepage — sidebar navigation, top header, content grid for playlists/artists/albums, and a footer — and uses local image assets for covers and thumbnails. A static single-page layout that mimics the look & feel of the Spotify web interface. Responsive styles so the layout adapts across screen sizes (desktop → tablet → mobile).

### Key features

- Sidebar navigation with library/playlist placeholders.

- Hero/top header area with call-to-action or sign-in links.

- Card/grid sections for popular artists, albums, playlists and charts.

- Footer area with site/company links and language selector.

- Responsive behavior implemented via CSS (flexbox/grid + media queries).

- Lightweight — no JavaScript required to render the UI.

### Technologies

- HTML5 — semantic structure and content.

- CSS3 — layout, responsive design, and visual styling.

- Static image assets (stored in the images/ folder).
